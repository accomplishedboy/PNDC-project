# PNDC-project

This Project that aimed to detecting nodules in lung and classify whether that nodule is benign or malignant is developed by
Jihoon Han for Graduation project.

This codes implemented on [Caffe modified by Noh, Hyeonwoo, et al](https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/caffe) with opencv2, Ipython, jupyter, matlab and other things. And All of this project codes will be released after graduation project presentation, november 2017.

# Workflow
### 1. Data
About 1400 CT-Images used to train and 220 CT-images for validation set, and 10 Images for Test.

### 2. Preprocessing
Will be posted after Graduation project presentation

### 3. Neural Network
Details will be posted after Graduation project presentation

### 4. Postprocessing
Will be posted after Graduation project presentation

### 5. Results
Details will be posted after Graduation project presentation

Average Accuracy : 99.6~7%

Average Loss : 6~10%
